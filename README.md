# go-pokedex
A simple go web app to show Pokémons

This is a simple sample of go web app, built entirely on research purposes.

Great thanks to:
* [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/) that provided the Pokémon image card and data resources;
* [Pokéwalls](https://pokewalls.wordpress.com/) that provided the Pokémon wallpaper image;

This project wouldn't been possible without their help.
